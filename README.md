# SIMON SINGS

## Introduction

Simon is a game of memory, based on sounds and colors! It was initally launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.

Traditionally, the tones were chosen to be harmonic, no matter how they were sequenced. I remember, as a child, being sucked into this game because of that reason. It felt like I was playing an instrument and learning a song. 

## Tasks for users

- This is a Human vs computer game
- The human hits start button to initialize game
- The computer (Simon) responds with the first note/color of the sequence
- The user has to mimic that exact note/color (by clicking it or possibly using key commands for a smoother interface)
- After the user makes their move, the computer repeats that first note/color and adds another one (chosen at random) as the next one in the sequence
- The user then has to mimic that sequence and so on until they mess up 
- The computer could keep score based on how long the sequence is, so the higher your score, the better you did

#### Some Specs

- Traditionally the colors and corresponding notes are:
  - Blue | E-note
  - Yellow | C#-note
  - Red | A-note
  - Green | E-note (octave lower than Blue)

- Simon Swipe (2014) uses
  - Blue | G-note
  - Yellow | C-note
  - Red | E-note
  - Green | G-note (octave _higher_ than Blue)

**Possible bonus features (workflow pending)**

- Different Audio options (chorus, strings, etc.)
- Possibly incorporating a real song you end up learning by playing the game
- Some sweet CSS animations to display the colors changing
- CSS Shapes
